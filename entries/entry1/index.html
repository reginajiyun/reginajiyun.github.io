    <div class="paragraph">
      <p class="paragraph-text">A rich soup called "hot pot" is typically served in a sizable metal pot. For the length of the dinner, the broth is simmered after being brought to a boil. Meat and vegetables that are still raw are prepared by simmering them in the broth. To add more taste, the fried pieces are dipped into dipping sauces. Hot pot is typically served without rice or noodles on the side and is regarded as a main entr√©e. Hot pots can be made and consumed in a restaurant or at home.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p class="paragraph-text">Thinly sliced meat, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, vermicelli, sliced potatoes, bean products, egg dumplings, tofu, and shellfish are common components in hot pots. Presliced raw materials are kept at a gentle boiling temperature so that they cook through fast and consistently in the simmering broth. The majority of raw foods may be cooked in a hot pot; however, their cooking periods may vary and they must be submerged in the soup and then taken out as needed.</p>
